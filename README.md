# Echo

> In Greek mythology, Echo was an Oread who resided on Mount Kithairon. Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and visited them on Earth often. Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came from Mt. Olympus in an attempt to catch Zeus with the nymphs. Echo, by trying to protect Zeus, endured Hera's wrath, and Hera made her only able to speak the last few words spoken to her.

Echo is a simple OSX menubar app which provides a GUI to the popular OSX command line application `say`.
